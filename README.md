# FinTech Pro – Quality Engineering

This repository demonstrates how I approach quality engineering
for a wealth management platform with high-risk financial and
security-sensitive workflows.

## Focus Areas
- Risk-based test selection
- API-first validation
- Minimal but meaningful UI automation
- Security and authorization testing

## What This Is
- A demonstration of test architecture and decision-making
- A realistic model of enterprise QA practices

## What This Is Not
- A full product automation suite
- A tool showcase or demo project

Quality here is treated as a system for reducing production risk.

This implementation follows the architecture defined in
`qe-foundation` and the quality principles documented in
`quality-by-design`.
